	- The standard three-letter residue identifiers in ATOM and HETATM
	  records may now contain four letters, making use of the unused
	  column after the normal three-letter ATOM code.  This change doesn't
	  effect the parsing or printing of standard PDB files and allows the
	  parsing and printing of nonstandard ones using four-letter residue
	  identifiers.

	- PDB files are required to have 80 characters per line, but many
	  programs fail to pad lines with spaces to make 80 characters.  PDB
	  records with fewer than six characters per line can now be handled
	  "correctly," allowing compatibility with the badly formatted PDB
	  files produced by some programs.

	- Some programs, notably scwrl4, include only spaces for
	  ATOM_TEMPFACTOR fields which should instead be zero if undefined.
	  This field, when only a space, was converted to an empty string when
	  processed by &parse_pdb_record.  But formatting these records with
	  &format_pdb_record resulted in an "argument isn't numeric in
	  formline" error.  Now ATOM_TEMPFACTOR fields with only spaces are
	  converted to the string "0.00", the correct value for when the
	  temperature factor is undefined.
