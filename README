MinimalPDB version 0.04
=======================

This is the fourth release of the MinimalPDB module.  The purpose of this
module is to allow users to easily work with the most essential PDB record
types: EXPDTA, REMARK, ATOM, HETATM, MODEL, and ENDMDL.  Other records can be
read, stored, and reformatted, but this module is not useful for parsing them.

This module provides a simple, dependency-free interface for handling PDB
data.  For a feature-rich solution, consider using the Bio::Structure::*
modules in the BioPerl package.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
