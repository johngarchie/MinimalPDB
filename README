MinimalPDB version 0.05
=======================

The purpose of the MinimalPDB module is to allow users to easily parse and
format the most essential PDB record types.  Currently supported types are
EXPDTA, REMARK, ATOM, HETATM, MODEL, and ENDMDL.  Other record types can be
read and formatted, but parsing and altering is tedious.

This module provides a simple, dependency-free interface for handling PDB
data.  For a feature-rich solution, consider using the Bio::Structure::*
modules in the BioPerl package.
